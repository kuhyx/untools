# CI mirror: reproduce what CI runs, locally, before push.
#
# `flutter clean` first, for the same reason the Python repos build a throwaway
# venv: a stale incremental build can hide a real failure, and a pre-push gate
# that only passes on an already-warm tree is not a gate.
#
# Three checks here have no equivalent in the sibling Flutter repos:
#   * the 100% line-coverage gate, which is this repo's hard bar;
#   * the completeness gate that keeps it honest, since a lib/ file no test
#     imports is missing from lcov.info entirely rather than reported at 0%;
#   * `flutter build web`, which is the only thing that catches a `dart:io`
#     import creeping into anything reachable from lib/main.dart. The analyzer
#     and the (VM-hosted) test suite are both perfectly happy with one.
